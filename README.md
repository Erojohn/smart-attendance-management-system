# smart-attendance-management-system
The current attendance system in most of the educational institutions is paper based, wherein the students are expected to sign an attendance sheet. This system has several disadvantages like:
(a) The students can mark attendance of their fellow classmates without being caught.
(b) Punctuality of individuals cannot be recorded
(c) Time consuming
(d) It can be lost easily
There are following features of attendance management software…
⦁	Ease to Access
⦁	Bio-metric Integration (Figure Print)
⦁	Absence/Leave management
⦁	Mobile Application
⦁	Class & Section wise attendance
⦁	Day wise attendance
⦁	Subject Wise Attendance
⦁	Morning, Afternoon Absent and Early Leave tracking
⦁	Analytics with graphs and reports
⦁	Send update via e-mail, SMS, and notification
⦁	Better accuracy
⦁	Increase the efficiency of HR staff
⦁	Increase employee productivity
⦁	Reduce admin costs
⦁	Data integrity
⦁	Reduce administrative work
SMART ATTENDANCE SYSTEM USES:
Improves employee management: As attendance software reduces errors in attendance management it leads to accurate payroll processing and reduces payroll redundancies.
Automates Generation of timesheet: Generating timesheets of employees becomes easier with automated time and attendance tracking software.
Reduces payroll inaccuracies: As attendance software records attendance accurately it paves way for accurate and error-free payroll processing.
Timesheet rectification made easy: Making rectification in timesheet is most tedious task for HR’s. Manually time tracking make it more difficult but with cloud based attendance software timesheet rectification becomes much easier.
We have tried to implement some of these features in our project.
This is a C++ project that is based on the important concept of data structure known as linked list, while the name of the project is "smart attendance system" .This project is basically full animated project. This project usually holds the important functions that are really needed for a Smart Attendance System.
What is Linked list? 
Usually Linked list can be define as it  is the most important and  basic form of a data structure. According to the  rules of data structure a linked list is more or less similar to an array . For explanation the major difference between a linked list and array is that an array (1D and 2D )can hold values belonging to the same data type only whereas there is no such restriction on a linked list.                                  
Functions of the Project:
1. PRESENT : Add Attendance Record
2. ABSENT : Delete Specify Record
3. ALL ABSENT : Delete All Records
4. Find A Record
5. Display All Atendance Records
6. About Developers 
Application:
It is used for marking attendance in educational institutions where attendance management is itself a time consuming and cumbersome process. It will make the attendance system smooth and reliable.
